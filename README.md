# IntrA: 3D Intracranial Aneurysm Dataset for Deep Learning

Instead of 2D medical images, we introduce an open-access 3D intracranial aneurysm dataset, IntrA, that makes the application of points-based and mesh-based classification and segmentation models available. Our dataset can be used to diagnose intracranial aneurysms and to extract the neck for a clipping operation in medicine and other areas of deep learning, such as normal estimation and surface reconstruction. 

The dataset could be download [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QIKznnjWpbNPalYAzTq8ETwQeNZU0RdS).

We are grateful for adding your information on this [form](https://forms.gle/Ae2FFZLjYKVxKzas5), if you think this dataset is useful.
Thank you!
