# IntrA: A 3D Intracranial Aneurysm Dataset for Deep Learning

We introduce an open free 3D intracranial aneurysm dataset with annotation, IntrA, instead of 2D medical images to make the application of points-based and mesh-based classification and segmentation models available. Our dataset could be employed to diagnose intracranial aneurysms and extract the neck for clipping operation in medicine, and other studies in deep learning.

The dataset could be download at [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QIKznnjWpbNPalYAzTq8ETwQeNZU0RdS).

We are grateful for adding your information on this [form](https://forms.gle/Ae2FFZLjYKVxKzas5), if you think this dataset is useful.
Thank you!
